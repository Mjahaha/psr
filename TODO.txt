Types of guys

- the archer 
- mage, fires bullets like on that hyperplex video

- sticky, he will be placed down and then the user draws an area, and he will paint that area with stickly glue, and anyone 
who goes in it slows to 1/3 speed

Teams 

Advanced pathing 
- See how it goes first 

Efficiency changes
- use sorted arrays to check bumps, because it only needs to happen based on nearest X + Y up and down, not every "same" item
Using binary search over sorted arrays
- create my arrays, six of them (X and Y for each item class)
- maintain my arrays when movement occurs 
- create the function to look up and down arrays for nearest item (for predators, prey and same).
- have some sort of memory of both the index in my array, and the distance to nearest predPreySame
