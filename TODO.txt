General changes 
- add a HUD for the game that
  a) shows how many items of each type are in play
  b) gives the user controls to set up field initially
- add move mousemove listener to data class and then update drawCircle and populateField to reflect this new listener 
- death pics 

Types of guys
- add an exemption to taking turns for when you have an animation
- big eater, gets 10px bigger when he captures, if he gets hit, knocks the other item away 100px and looses a sized
- mage, fires bullets like on that hyperplex video
- necromancer?
- sticky, he will be placed down and then the user draws an area, and he will paint that area with stickly glue, and anyone 
who goes in it slows to 1/3 speed  

Menu changes 
- make a menu screen
- make the item counter visual stack the items like playing cards, then add a new line ones it gets to x amount

Teams 


Efficiency changes
- use sorted arrays to check bumps, because it only needs to happen based on nearest X + Y up and down, not every "same" item
Using binary search over sorted arrays
- create my arrays, six of them (X and Y for each item class)
- maintain my arrays when movement occurs 
- create the function to look up and down arrays for nearest item (for predators, prey and same).
- have some sort of memory of both the index in my array, and the distance to nearest predPreySame
